               <p>This week&#39;s update was pretty good.</p>
               <p>First, the game, and this website, is now in Github. Not a big milestone by any means, but good
                  to know that I won&#39;t lose my work, or too much of my work.
               </p>
               <p>The game now has a simple main menu. Admittedly, it was easier to put together than I thought it
                  would be. The menu acts as a &quot;Room&quot; in GameMaker, has centered text, a and .gif as a sprite for the
                  background.
               </p>
               <p>The way selection is done is:</p>
               <pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">// create event</span>
menu_pointer = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
menu_items[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"NEW GAME"</span>;
menu_items[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"BRIEFING"</span>;
menu_items[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"CREDITS"</span>;
menu_items[<span class="hljs-number">3</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"EXIT GAME"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// step event</span>
var _up_key     = keyboard_check_released(ord(<span class="hljs-string">"W"</span>));
var _down_key   = keyboard_check_released(ord(<span class="hljs-string">"S"</span>));
var _z_key      = keyboard_check_released(ord(<span class="hljs-string">"Z"</span>));

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> _up_key {
    menu_pointer -= <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> menu_pointer &lt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> {
        menu_pointer = array_length(menu_items) - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    }
    audio_play_sound(snd_menu_select, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> _down_key {
    menu_pointer += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> menu_pointer &gt; array_length(menu_items) - <span class="hljs-number">1</span> {
        menu_pointer = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    }
    audio_play_sound(snd_menu_select, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> _z_key {
    audio_play_sound(snd_main_menu_confirm, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span>(menu_pointer) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:
            room_goto(rm_test_0); <span class="hljs-comment">// first level</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
            room_goto(rm_briefing);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>:
            room_goto(rm_credits);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span>:
            game_end(0);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>
               <p>And that is literally all the code required. I don&#39;t show it in today&#39;s update video, but BRIEFING
                  and CREDITS are rooms that exist, but there&#39;s nothing in them.
               </p>
               <p>As shown, the player can now move between rooms. Again, this was easier than I thought it would be
                  and makes sense upon seeing the concept. I have an empty <code>obj_warp</code> that when the player collides with,
                  just like standard collisions, &quot;warps&quot; them to a new room at a given <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> location. There is
                  some more work to be done here perhaps on fade outs/fade ins, but the core concept is there. I&#39;ve linked
                  my resource for this above.
               </p>
               <p>Its a work in progress but part of the how radio calls will work is simlar to this, as I am currently
                  planning on &quot;warping&quot; the player to &quot;call room&quot;, that takes in an argument for a specific set of
                  text and variables. We&#39;ll see how that pans out.
               </p>
               <p>I thought about implementing footsteps as a whole, but as I am not going to have walking or crouch
                  walking in game, I didn&#39;t find it to be worthwhile. What does exist now in game is what I&#39;m calling
                  &quot;noisy floors&quot;. These can be expanded upon for various sounds in the future, and while currently guards
                  are pretty dumb, and can&#39;t see/hear anything, they will be able to in the future.
               </p>
               <p>I haven&#39;t wanted to spend too much time on story or &quot;lore&quot; as while I think, like any Metal Gear game,
                  that will be an important part, it is something that can be done later. I do have some various tidbits
                  &quot;on paper&quot;, did sort out the overall world map to limit scope, but not trying to have this be a
                  narrative exercise. Below is what a version one of what the world map looks like. Its not shown but a
                  &quot;version zero&quot; of the first level also exists, in pencil (which means its 100% subject to change).
               </p>
               <img width="400px" src="../img/map-concept.jpg" />
               <p>It is not shown in this week&#39;s video but I completed very basic pathing for patrols, and the guard
                  animates correctly based on their movement. Guards, like in Ghost Babel (ando other Metal Gear games),
                  will have various colors/sprites for their region but I need a base &quot;guard&quot; object that everything can
                  inherit from, and that is what I am working on.
               </p>
               <p>One last thing that was shown was how the camera follows the player throughout the level. If we look
                  back at last week&#39;s video we see a very small sprite, and are zoomed out quite far. One thing all
                  Metal Gear games have is a relatively zoomed in camera on the player, to not only show neat animations
                  but also have it be a challenge to spot all the enemies on the map. I looked at Ghost Babel&#39;s proportions
                  and while not exactly the same, it is a similar size (the player sprite) on the screen.
               </p>
               <p>And that&#39;s really it. Along with working on the &quot;call/radio&quot; system, I&#39;m workong on when the player
                  can &quot;hug&quot; the wall. This will move the viewport in one direction or the other, and a player will be
                  able to &quot;knock&quot; on the wall to distract a nearby guard.
               </p>
               <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
